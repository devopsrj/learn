# Operators

- Operators are the tools you use to work with your software's data. With operators, you can compare data to other data.

Group of operators:

- Arithmetic Operators: math-related tasks as addition and others.
- Comparison Operators: Compare two values (equal, not equal and others)
- Logical Operators: Boolean Values (True and False)
- Address Operators? Used to work with pointers
- Receive Operators: Used with Go Channels

## Shorthand Operators

- --: Reduce a number by 1
- ++: Increase a number by 1
- +=: Add and assign
- -=: Subtract and assign

## Comparison Operators

- == True if two values are the same
- != True if two values are not the same
- < True if the left value is less than the right value
- <= True if the left value is less or equal to the right value
- > True if the left value is greater than the right value
- >= True if the left value is greater than or equal to the right value

## Logical Operators

- && True if the left and right values are both true
- || True if one or both the left and right values are true
- ! This operator only works with a single value and results in true if the value is false

## Zero Values
